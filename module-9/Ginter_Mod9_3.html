      <h2>Jeremy Ginter Introduction</h2>
      <p class="intro">
        My name is Jeremy Ginter. I am 22 years old, and I live in Vancouver, WA. 
        I currently work at Home Depot, and have worked there for just over two years. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
        In my free time, I enjoy doing pretty much anything in nature. 
        Living in the Pacific Northwest, it's hard not to take advantage of the endless supply of hiking trails.
        I also enjoy going mountain bike riding, and kayaking when the weather allows. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
        My family consists of my Father, Mother, and younger Sister. We also have Two Dogs and a Cat. 
        My Dog is an Australian Shepherd named Whitney, and my sister's cat and dog are named Goose and Finn respectively. 
      </p>
      
      
     
      <p>
        I started working at Home Depot as a cashier. I have since been promoted to Head Cashier.
        This is essentially a shift lead possition, and it means I am responsible for the schedule and any problems the cashiers face throughout the day.
        This also means I have to walk throughout the store constantly, which can be rather tiring.

        Sam's Speech:
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span id="first">____</span>: I know! It’s all wrong!
        By rights we shouldn’t even be here.
        But we are.
        It's like in the great stories Mr. Frodo.
        The ones that really mattered.<br />
        Full of <span id="second">____</span> and danger they were,
        and sometimes you didn't want to know the end.
        Because how could the end be happy.
        How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad happened.<br />
        But in the end, it's only a passing thing, this <span id="third">____</span>.
        Even darkness must pass.
        A new day will come.
        And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer.
        Those were the stories that stayed with you.
        That meant something.
        Even if you were too small to understand why. <br />
        But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand.
        I know now.
        Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back only they didn’t
        Because they were holding on to something.<br />
        <span id="fourth">____</span>.: What are we holding on to, Sam?<br />
        Sam : That there’s some good in this world, Mr. Frodo. And it’s worth fighting for.
      </p>
