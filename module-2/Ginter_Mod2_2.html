      <h2>Jeremy Ginter Introduction</h2>
      <p class="intro">
        <span class="sentence"> My name is Jeremy Ginter.</span> I am 22 years old, and I live in Vancouver, WA. 
        I currently work at Home Depot, and have worked there for just over two years. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span class="sentence">In my free time, I enjoy doing pretty much anything in nature.</span> 
        Living in the Pacific Northwest, it's hard not to take advantage of the endless supply of hiking trails.
        I also enjoy going mountain bike riding, and kayaking when the weather allows. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span class="sentence">My family consists of my Father, Mother, and younger Sister.</span> We also have Two Dogs and a Cat. 
        My Dog is an Australian Shepherd named Whitney, and my sister's cat and dog are named Goose and Finn respectively. 
      </p>
      
      
     
      <p>
        <span class="sentence">I started working at Home Depot as a cashier.</span> I have since been promoted to Head Cashier.
        This is essentially a shift lead possition, and it means I am responsible for the schedule and any problems the cashiers face throughout the day.
        This also means I have to walk throughout the store constantly, which can be rather tiring.
